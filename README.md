Project Overview
This project shows the analysis of historical airplane crash data from 1948 to the present to identify trends in crash frequency, fatalities, and overall aviation safety.

Objectives
- Analyze long-term trends in airplane crashes
- Examine changes in fatality rates over time
- Identify aircraft types and operators most frequently involved in crashes

Tools Used - For this project I used

- DAX
- Power Query

 Key Insights
- Crash frequency increased steadily until the 1970s, followed by a gradual decline
- Fatality rates show a long-term decrease, reflecting improvements in aviation safety
- Certain aircraft types and operators account for a higher share of recorded crashes
